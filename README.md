The FFXIV RAF Bot utilizes [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started_with_webdriver/) to open FireFox, login to the Mogstation with given credentials from a .env file, navigate to the page where Recruit-A-Friend codes are generated, copy the code, post the code on the official FFXIV forum in the Recruit-A-Friend Code thread, and post the code in the FFXIV: Recruit-A-Friend subreddit. Since it uses Selenium, it can do this while running in the background.

It logs the code and the URLs of the posts it creates in a "bot.log" file that it creates. Since recruitment codes can only be generated every 3 hours, it will check the log for the last time it posted a code and only continue if it has been longer than 3 hours since that time. If it hasn't, it will print a message in the terminal with the time remaining until the 3 hours have passed.

Since the bot is using Selenium to run FireFox, it requires [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/).
